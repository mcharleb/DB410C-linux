Create a Debian rootfs for DragonBoard 410C

This uses qemu to handle the second-stage of the debootstrap and uses
qemu-debootstrap called from grml-debootstrap. 

You will need to have these packages installed:

	sudo apt-get install wget grml-debootstrap android-tools android-tools-fsutils

1. Run make. That will create debian-rootfs.img

2. Boot the DB410c with the Linaro Ubuntu release from the SD card installer. 
   This will partition the eMMC appropriately. These instructions assume you have priviously run Linaro Ubuntu
   based release on the board.

3. Use the recovery disk image to boot the DB410C into fastboot. Make sure the dip switch for SD Boot is ON.

4. Write the images to the board: make flashall

5. Pop out the SD card and reboot

4. Login (root, root)

5. Start the network time server: timedatectl set-ntp true
